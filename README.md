# COSI 146 ASR - Assessment 1

## Repository files

Here is a list of the files in the repository that are relevant to this part of the project and their brief description:

- folder ```text``` with all txt files.
- notebooks ```czech_base``` and ```czech_small```. We ended up with two notebook files because of the way we divided the project. One person was responsible for training the Whisper-base model and the other person was responsible for training the Whisper-small model. 
- script ```resample_files``` used for resampling and rechanelling the wav files.
- txt files ```train_files``` and ```test_files``` that contain the filnames of training and test files respectively.
- final writeup for this project ```COSI_136_Project_2```.

## Executing the notebook files

There are some requirements to execute the notebook files:

- the files```train_files.txt``` and ```test_files.txt``` (found in this repository) and zip folders ```uniform_output``` and ```text``` (found in Google Drive) need to be located in your Google Drive.
- you will need to enter your Hub authentication token when prompted.

If you experience any problems running the notebooks, please feel free to contact us.

## Additional data

The text and audio files turned out to be too large to be added to Github,
that's why we share them via Google drive. For convenience, here is the link to all zip files:

- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OuI069vIWgV_NFSYERJRdmcF71Ebb2Pz

These zip files include the same-length wav files and their corresponding txt files with transcriptions.
